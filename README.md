# CS2253-PROJECT

## Brief About My Task

I extended the basic traffic light simulation by adding key features to enhance safety, interactivity, and realism:

Task 3: Yellow light duration is dynamically calculated based on user-entered speed limits.

Task 4: A pedestrian crossing button allows users to simulate safe pedestrian interaction.

A countdown timer displays time remaining for each light phase.
At the end, the program shows a summary of total cycles, pedestrian crossings, and average speed.
